# Cliarith
_NOTE: This is under construction._

CLiArith is a _trial_ and simple implementation of the interval arithmetic in Common Lisp based on the implementation coded by C/C++ ([Simple Interval Arithmeric Library](http://verifiedby.me/kv/simple/index-e.html)).

_CLiArith is available only in SBCL._
